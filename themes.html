					<p style="text-align:left">One of the most interesting aspects of this project, personally, was the undeniably obvious recurrence of select themes across the spectrum of participant answers. I pinpointed these themes and have gathered the most prevalent ones here, accompanied by corresponding quotes. The quotes were taken directly from the survey write-in portions, and remain unedited and unmanipulated.</p>
